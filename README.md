Performance of PageRank using **32-bit floats** vs **64-bit floats** ([pull], [CSR]).

This experiment was for comparing the performance between:
1. Find pagerank using *32-bit floats* (**float**).
2. Find pagerank using *64-bit floats* (**double**).

Both datatypes were attempted on different types of graphs, running each
technique 5 times per graph to get a good time measure. It seems using
**double** datatype **increases execution time by a small factor** in all cases.
This could be attributed to increased memory bandwidth requirement. However,
since most of the data for a graph (CSR) is stored as 32-bit ints, it possibly
makes up most of the memory bottleneck, and not the rank vector. Note that
neither approach makes use of *SIMD instructions* which are available on all
modern hardware.

All outputs are saved in [out](out/) and a small part of the output is listed
here. Some [charts] are also included below, generated from [sheets]. The input
data used for this experiment is available at ["graphs"] (for small ones), and
the [SuiteSparse Matrix Collection]. This experiment was done with guidance
from [Prof. Dip Sankar Banerjee] and [Prof. Kishore Kothapalli].
